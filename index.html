                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi üëã I‚Äôm <strong>Yi FAN</strong>, a master student (currently in Honor Program) at Ming Hsieh Department of <strong>Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Southern California</strong>, specializing in <strong>Machine Learning and Data Science</strong>.</p>
                <p>My research Interest covers <strong>Physics-informed Neural Networks, Generative Models, Theoretical Machine Learning</strong>. I am currently an independent Course Producer for course EE541: a computational introduction to Deep Learning in USC, where I independently conceptualized, drafted and authored concise, structured lecture handouts on deep learning, enriched with interdisciplinary insights from Physics and ECE to offer a unique perspective beyond standard course materials. </p>
                <p>Before my new journey in the USA, I had a wonderful time at <strong>Fudan University</strong>, Shanghai, China, and earned a Bachelor's degree in <strong>Physics</strong>. Professor <strong><a href="http://www.physics.fudan.edu.cn/tps/people/ptan/homepage/home.html" target="_blank">Peng TAN</a></strong> generously guided me in my research on soft condensed matter physics. Alongside my academic pursuits, I worked for <strong>McKinsey & Company</strong> as a Part-Time Assistant, where I met a remarkable group of young colleagues full of ideas and creativity.</p>
                <p>At heart, I‚Äôm a pure idealist who embraces the beauty of a <strong>nonlinear</strong>, adventurous life. Beyond my professional study, my curiosity extends to astronomy, philosophy of physics, and Eastern literature. I‚Äôm also passionate about the outdoors and proudly consider myself an <strong>adventurer</strong> ‚Äî just as Thoreau once said, "I went to the woods / because I wished to live deliberately!"</p>
                <p>If you‚Äôre looking for the perfect rooftop to catch a romantic sunset, feel free to join me on an exploration! üòä</p>

                    <h3>Astrophile! üî≠</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was once a member of the Academic Department of the <strong>Fudan University Astronomy Society</strong>, 
                        where I embarked on outdoor adventures with like-minded friends, drifting across landscapes in search of romantic rooftops and dazzling starry skies. 
                        I participated in two self-organized astronomy education summer camps‚Äîthe "<strong>Tianwen</strong>" project‚Äîbringing astronomy and art education 
                        to children in <strong>Shizuishan, Ningxia, 2023</strong> and <strong>Geyuan, Jiangxi, 2024</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, in California, I still chase my own <strong>romantic sunsets</strong>, venturing to hidden rooftops and scenic spots. 
                        One day, I hope to gather enough funds to finally purchase my own <strong>telescope</strong>‚ÄîLOL! 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="hobby-entry">
                    <h3>Bookworm! üìö</h3>
                    <p>
                        In my free time, I enjoy a little game of fate‚Äîrolling the dice to decide which of my four favorite libraries at USC
                        will host my afternoon of literary indulgence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I must admit, rather than immersing myself solely in rigorous academic research, 
                        I find myself drawn to the profound yet tender existentialism of <strong>Albert Camus</strong>, 
                        the introspective and melancholic charm of <strong>Fernando Pessoa</strong>, 
                        or the intricate, dreamlike storytelling of <strong>Haruki Murakami</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why is it that, despite being a STEM student, my mind is constantly preoccupied with astronomy, philosophy, and culture? 
                        Perhaps that is precisely what it means to be human.
                    </p>
                    <p class="feynman-quote">
                        Finally, I‚Äôd like to share a quote from my idol, the physicist <strong>Richard Feynman</strong>:  
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "So I have just one wish for you‚Äîthe good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain 
                        the kind of integrity I have described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain 
                        your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. 
                        May you have that freedom."

                        Inspired by <strong>Haruki Murakami</strong>‚Äôs <em>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</em>, 
                        I have gradually fallen in love with long-distance running, making it a part of my life‚Äîa long-term commitment of passion and perseverance.
